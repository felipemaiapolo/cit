# Code for the paper "Conditional independence testing under model misspecification"

All the code was run in Python 3.8. Please e-mail me (felipemaiapolo@gmail.com) if you have any questions. The main files in this repo are:

1. `linear_model_experiment*.ipynb`: these notebooks generate the plots of the experiments involving high-dimensional regression;
2. `real_data_experiment_competing_models*.ipynb`: in these notebooks, we generate the Type-I error and p-values plot for the real data experiment;
3. `artificial_data_experiments.ipynb`: in this notebook, we generate the artificial data experiments plots;
4. `exp1.py`, `exp2.py`, and `general.py`: source code used in the artificial data experiments, real data experiments, and general functions.
