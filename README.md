# Code for the paper "Conditional independence testing under model misspecification"

This repo is still being updated. Please e-mail me (felipemaiapolo@gmail.com) if you have any questions. The main files in this repo are:

1. `linear_model_experiment*`: these notebooks generate the plots the experiments involving high-dimensional regression;
2. `real_data_experiment.ipynb`: in this notebook, we generate the p-values plot for the real data experiment;
3. `real_data_experiment_competing_models.ipynb`: in this notebook, we generate the Type-I error plot for the real data experiment;
4. `artificial_data_experiments.ipynb`: in this notebook, we generate the artifical data experiemnts plots;
5. `exp1.py`, `exp2.py`, and `generate.py`: source code used in the artificial data experiments, real data experiment, and general functions.
